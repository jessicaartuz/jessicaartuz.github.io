<p>
	My name is Jessica Artuz I am a Skyline College and San Francisco graduate in Child Development concentrated in Early Childhood. I am currently taking a few computer science courses at College of San Mateo and full time at San Francisco State University in a masters focused in instructional technology. I have been a preschool teacher for 4 year to support each family in documenting their childâ€™s development. 
</p>


<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>For years, I noticed most preschool teachers seem to struggle using computer applications. While I was in my undergraduate program, I was required to work as a preschool teacher while maintaining the assignments and projects as a full-time student. Early childhood educators are required to document each child's progress in their care, implement meaningful curriculum, ensure safety and manage the classroom, maintain communication within the team, families, and children. Therefore, I am taking this course because I want to be able to create a type of online community for teachers to collaborate on the different tasks that are given to early childhood educators. We are expected to teach the young developing minds, self-care, self-expression, empathy, curiosity and prepare them from kindergarten. Another concern that I have is the lack of communication and understanding of expectation between early childhood and kindergarten teachers. </p>
